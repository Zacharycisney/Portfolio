                            For specifics on how the initial loading of flights and passengers works, see part one. Part two focuses on adding, 
                            deleting, and modifying passenger seats.

                        <p>
                            When no passenger is selected, the delete and change buttons are disabled, ensuring that the only available option 
                            is the add button. Once the add button is clicked, the combo boxes and other buttons are disabled, and a pop-up window 
                            prompts the user to enter a first and last name. After clicking the save button, the only remaining action is for the user 
                            to select and confirm a seat.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The change button requires a passenger to be selected. Once the process begins, the combo boxes and delete/add buttons 
                            are disabled. After making a selection, the user can commit the changes. The delete button simply removes the 
                            passenger from the database and updates the flight map accordingly.

                            This assignment was a valuable lesson in collaborating with team members. My professor provided me with another student's 
                            code, and I had to evaluate which parts were well-written and which were unusable. While it took me some time to assess the 
                            code, in hindsight, starting from scratch might have saved me a lot of time.

                            <!-- Description -->
                            The banking app allows a user, whether they are a customer, employee, or admin, to make
                            transactions, change roles, or view transaction history based on their role.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The banking app uses Express, React, MongoDB, and Node to display and store data. The
                            backend is designed with routes to set up accounts, perform transactions, change roles, and
                            retrieve customer information.
                            Transactions can be recalled by comparing their date and associated customerID with the
                            currently selected customer.
                            By utilizing sessions and backend banking routes, the program can transfer data during
                            transactions or verify a user's login by comparing the stored hashed password with the
                            current hashed password.
                            Sessions also allow the frontend to access customer data stored in the middleware when a
                            user logs in.
                            This easy access to data in the middle layer makes it quicker to display account statistics.
                            Finally, the frontend UI does a fantastic job of presenting
                            all user information in a friendly and informative manner. The animations and notifications
                            help users quickly and easily understand what is happening. One point
                            that our team was uncertain about was whether or not to create a separate page for customers
                            to make transactions within their own accounts, in addition to transactions that can be made
                            to other users.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My role in this assignment was to determine how to store all user data and access their
                            transactions, as well as writing the routes that would access these transactions. My
                            secondary
                            contribution was helping to connect and debug how sessions would interface with the
                            frontend.

                            This is a super simple banking app that allows users to move money within their own account.
                            There is no styling because this
                            program focuses on using routes and session tracking with CORS.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This program was my first attempt at using sessions. I learned how the frontend and backend
                            communicate in a modern MERN
                            programming stack. The routes handled most of the work for transferring money, while the
                            session provided minimal user input validation.
