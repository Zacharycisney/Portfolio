                            <!-- Description -->
                            This was a final group project that utilizes a database file to access inventory and invoices
                            for a hypothetical small company. There were three different panels: <code>wndMain</code>, <code>wndSearch</code>, and 
                            <code>wndItems</code>. The main window links the search and items windows in addition to creating new 
                            invoices. The search window allows for filtering invoices and selecting an invoice, which then opens
                            in the <code>wndMain</code> panel. The item window allows users to create, modify, and delete items.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This project consisted of myself and two other team members. 
                            My specific task for this assignment was to implement the <code>wndSearch</code> panel. The three filters 
                            for searching invoices are based on invoice number, date, and total amount. The
                            filters can be cleared, or an invoice can be selected and passed back to the main window.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The overall implementation of the filters is very simple and repetitive. When any new filter
                            requirements are provided, they are passed into the <code>clsSearchLogic</code> file, which performs an SQL
                            query. Any filter that was left blank is not included in the query. Invoice selection is
                            also straightforwardâ€”once an invoice is selected, it can be opened in the main window.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Side note on group dynamics</h4>
                        <p>
                            This group project was a great lesson in teamwork and communication. All points that were lost
                            were due to the fact that the pages were not connected and the main page did not display selected
                            invoices. While I left a large note in the <code>wndSearch.xaml.cs</code> file specifying the code that 
                            passes the selected invoice, as well as a video walking through the code, I believe that my 
                            teammate either ran out of time or did not understand the code.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This experience taught me that even with clean code and good communication, team dynamics 
                            can sometimes lead to unexpected outcomes. The best we can do is take it in stride.
                        </p>

                            For specifics on how the initial loading of flights and passengers works, see part one. Part two focuses on adding, 
                            deleting, and modifying passenger seats.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When no passenger is selected, the delete and change buttons are disabled, ensuring that the only available option 
                            is the add button. Once the add button is clicked, the combo boxes and other buttons are disabled, and a pop-up window 
                            prompts the user to enter a first and last name. After clicking the save button, the only remaining action is for the user 
                            to select and confirm a seat.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The change button requires a passenger to be selected. Once the process begins, the combo boxes and delete/add buttons 
                            are disabled. After making a selection, the user can commit the changes. The delete button simply removes the 
                            passenger from the database and updates the flight map accordingly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This assignment was a valuable lesson in collaborating with team members. My professor provided me with another student's 
                            code, and I had to evaluate which parts were well-written and which were unusable. While it took me some time to assess the 
                            code, in hindsight, starting from scratch might have saved me a lot of time.

                            <!-- Description -->
                            The airline reservation app allows an employee to look up available seats and select a seat for a customer. In part 
                            one, the seats are loaded from a file (which serves as a database) so they can be displayed. Each seat is linked to a 
                            passenger's name, allowing the information to be accessed when the seat is clicked. 
                        </p>
                        <h4>FlightManager.cs</h4>
                        <p>
                            When the application starts, flights and passengers are loaded into their respective objects by the flight 
                            manager file. The flight manager uses two methods, both of which function similarly by querying the 
                            database for specific attributes, which are then grouped by flights and passengers. 
                        </p>
                        <h4>MainWindow.xaml.cs</h4>
                        <p>
                            After the two method calls to the flight manager file, the list of flights and passengers is loaded into 
                            the buttons and combo boxes. Specifically, for the buttons, when a flight is selected, the button layout is determined 
                            by the make and model of the plane. The buttons are initially loaded with minimal attributes. Once the 
                            seats are operational, they are updated to reflect the passengers and their selected seats. An event listener is added, 
                            along with the appropriate background and seat number. After the flights and passengers are properly loaded, the combo boxes 
                            are enabled. 
                        </p>
