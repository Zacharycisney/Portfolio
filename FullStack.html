                            <!-- Description -->
                            The banking app allows a user, whether they are a customer, employee, or admin, to make
                            transactions, change roles, or view transaction history based on their role.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The banking app uses Express, React, MongoDB, and Node to display and store data. The
                            backend is designed with routes to set up accounts, perform transactions, change roles, and
                            retrieve customer information.
                            Transactions can be recalled by comparing their date and associated customerID with the
                            currently selected customer.
                            By utilizing sessions and backend banking routes, the program can transfer data during
                            transactions or verify a user's login by comparing the stored hashed password with the
                            current hashed password.
                            Sessions also allow the frontend to access customer data stored in the middleware when a
                            user logs in.
                            This easy access to data in the middle layer makes it quicker to display account statistics.
                            Finally, the frontend UI does a fantastic job of presenting
                            all user information in a friendly and informative manner. The animations and notifications
                            help users quickly and easily understand what is happening. One point
                            that our team was uncertain about was whether or not to create a separate page for customers
                            to make transactions within their own accounts, in addition to transactions that can be made
                            to other users.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My role in this assignment was to determine how to store all user data and access their
                            transactions, as well as writing the routes that would access these transactions. My
                            secondary
                            contribution was helping to connect and debug how sessions would interface with the
                            frontend.

                            <!-- Description -->
                            The hangman game generates a random word that the user must guess. They have a limited
                            number of guesses before they lose, but if they win, their score will be displayed on the
                            winners' chart if they are among the top 10 winners.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Similar to the banking app, this project uses a MongoDB, Express, React, and Node stack.
                            When a user enters their name, it is stored, and a random word is generatedâ€”both are stored
                            in sessions.
                            Multiple collections are created to track words, scores/players, and guessed letters. The
                            guessed letters are cleared out when a new game is started, and once a player
                            wins, their score is stored in the scores collection.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My role in this project was to create the collections and write the routes that would access
                            the players, scores, and guessed letters. In the original routes file, there was a route
                            that would take the secret word, iterate through its length, and compare the characters to
                            the guessed letters. If there was a matching character with a guessed letter, it would
                            be displayed; if not, a blank space would be added. This was an accessibility issue, so this
                            route was adapted into a session route to make it more easily accessible.
                        </p>

                            This is a super simple banking app that allows users to move money within their own account.
                            There is no styling because this
                            program focuses on using routes and session tracking with CORS.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This program was my first attempt at using sessions. I learned how the frontend and backend
                            communicate in a modern MERN
                            programming stack. The routes handled most of the work for transferring money, while the
                            session provided minimal user input validation.

                            <!-- Description -->
                            This game used a grid of buttons that players could click to place a piece on the board.
                            Once a player had four pieces
                            that matched diagonally, laterally, or vertically, they would win. The program used a
                            boolean to determine which
                            player was placing a piece and informed the winning player that they had won once their
                            winning move was performed.
                            The interesting part about this game was the way we checked for a winning combination. We
                            would pass in the buttons
                            that could form a winning combination, and if it returned true, we would find the color and
                            inform that colored player
                            that they had won.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One issue that arose with this program was that I had incorrectly labeled my UI, which
                            prevented my checks from determining
                            if the correct combination requirements had been met. After using many console logs, I
                            finally found and fixed the problem.
