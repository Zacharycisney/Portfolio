                            <!-- Description -->

                            The banking app allows a user who is either a customer, employee or admin to: make transactions, change roles or see tranaction history based on what role they are.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The banking app uses Express, React, MongoDB and Node to display and store data. The backend uses routes to set up accounts, perform transaction, change roles and retrive a customer. 
                            The backend is set up so that transactions can be recalled by comparing their date and associated customerID with the current customer that is selected.  
                            By utilizing sessions and the backend bankingRoutes the program can transfer the date when making a transaction or determine if a play has entered the correct login by comparing the 
                            stored hash password and the current password that has been hashed. Sessions also allows the frontend access to a customer which is stored in the middleware when a user logs in.
                            By allowing the frontend to have easy access to the data in the middle it is much easier and quicker to show account stats. Finally the frontend UI does a fantastic job of displaying
                            all of the user information in a friendly manner that is infomative. The animations and notifications allow for the user to quickly and easily understand what is happening. One point 
                            that our team was uncertian about was wither of not to make a seperate page for customers that want to make transactions in their own account in addtion to the transactions that can 
                            be made to other users as well. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My role on this assingment was to determine how to store all the users and access their transactions in addition to writting the routes that would access these transactions. My secondary 
                            contribution was helping to connect and debug how sessions would interface with the frontend.

                            <!-- Description -->
                            The hangman game generates a random word that the user then has to guess. They have a limited amount of guess before they loose and if they win their score will be display on the
                            winners chart if they are in top 10 winners.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Similar to the banking app this is a MongoDB, Express, React and Node stack. When a user enters their name it is stored and a random word is generated both are stored in sessions. 
                            There are multiple collections that are created to track word, scores/players and guessed letters. The guessed letters are cleared out when a new game is started  and once a player 
                            wins their score is stored in the scores collection. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My part in this project was to create the collections and write the routes which would access the players, scores and guessed letter. In the original routes file there was a route
                            with would take the secret word and iterate throught the length of word and compare the chars to the guessed letters. If there was a matching char wiht a guessed letter it would 
                            then be displayed and if not then there would be a blank space added. This was an accessiblity issue so this route was adapted into a session route to become easily accessible.

                            This a super simple banking app that allowed for users to move money around with in their own account. There is no styling
                            becuase this program was focused on using routes and session tracking using cors.

                        <p>
                            This program was my first attempt at using sessions. I learned how the front end and backend talked to each other in a modern MERN
                            progamming stack. The routes did a huge amount of the work when it came to transfering money will the session gave the user input 
                            did minimal user input validation.

                            <!-- Description -->
                            This game used a gride of buttons which the players could click and a piece to the bord. Once a player had four pieces that matched diagnoally, lateralliy or verticly 
                            then they would win. The program used a boolean to determine which player was placing a piece informed the winning play that they had won once their winning 
                            move was performed. The interesting part about this game was they way in which we checked for a winning combonation. We would pass in the buttons which could be a 
                            winning combonation and then if it returned true we would then find the color and inform that colored player that they had one. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One thing that became an issue with this program was that I had incorrectly labeled my UI and my checks could not determine if the correct combonation requirments had 
                            been met. After using many console logs I had finally found and fixed the problem.
