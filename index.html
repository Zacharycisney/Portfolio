                        <h2>How The Banking App Works</h2>
                        <p>
                            <!-- Description -->
                            The banking app uses Express, MongoDB and Node to display and store data. The backend uses routes to set up accounts, perform transaction, change roles and retrive a customer. 
                            The backend is set up so that transactions can be recalled by comparing their date and associated customerID with the current customer that is selected.  
                            By utilizing sessions and the backend bankingRoutes the program can transfer the date when making a transaction or determine if a play has entered the correct login by comparing the 
                            stored hash password and the current password that has been hashed. Sessions also allows the frontend access to a customer which is stored in the middleware when a user logs in.
                            By allowing the frontend to have easy access to the data in the middle it is much easier and quicker to show account stats. Finally the frontend UI does a fantastic job of displaying
                            all of the user information in a friendly manner that is infomative. The animations and notifications allow for the user to quickly and easily understand what is happening. One point 
                            that our team was uncertian about was wither of not to make a seperate page for customers that want to make transactions in their own account in addtion to the transactions that can 
                            be made to other users as well. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My role on this assingment was to determine how to store all the users and access their transactions in addition to writting the routes that would access these transactions. My secondary 
                            contribution was helping to connect and debug how sessions would interface with the frontend.
