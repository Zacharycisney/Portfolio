                            When no passenger is selected the delete and change button is disabled so that the only option the user can interface
                            with is the add button. Once the button is pushed the combo boxes and other buttons are disabled and a pop-up window 
                            asks for a first and last name. When the save button is pushed the only option for the user is to select and confirm a
                            seat.

                            The change button requires a passenger to be selected. Once the process starts the combo boxes and delete/add buttons
                            are disabled. When a selection is made the user is able to commit the changes. The delete button simply removes the 
                            passenger from the database and updates the flight map accordingly.

                            This assignment was a great lesson on working with team members. My professor gave me the code of another student and I had to
                            determine which pieces were written wisely and which were unusable and while it took me a while to determine in the end it saved
                            a lot of time in the long run.

                            <!-- Description -->
                            The hangman game generates a random word that the user must guess. They have a limited
                            number of guesses before they lose, but if they win, their score will be displayed on the
                            winners' chart if they are among the top 10 winners.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Similar to the banking app, this project uses a MongoDB, Express, React, and Node stack.
                            When a user enters their name, it is stored, and a random word is generatedâ€”both are stored
                            in sessions.
                            Multiple collections are created to track words, scores/players, and guessed letters. The
                            guessed letters are cleared out when a new game is started, and once a player
                            wins, their score is stored in the scores collection.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My role in this project was to create the collections and write the routes that would access
                            the players, scores, and guessed letters. In the original routes file, there was a route
                            that would take the secret word, iterate through its length, and compare the characters to
                            the guessed letters. If there was a matching character with a guessed letter, it would
                            be displayed; if not, a blank space would be added. This was an accessibility issue, so this
                            route was adapted into a session route to make it more easily accessible.

                            <!-- Description -->
                            The airline reservation app allows for an employee to look-up available seats and select a seat for customer. In part 
                            one the seats are loaded in from a file (which serves as a database) so that they can be displayed. The names are 
                            tied to the seat so that they may be accessed when clicked. 
                        </p>
                        <h4>FlightManager.cs</h4>
                        <p>
                            When the application starts the flights and passengers are loaded into their respective objects by the flight 
                            manager file. Flight manager uses two methods, both of which function in a similar manner by querying into the
                            database for specific attributes which are grouped by flights and passengers. 
                        </p>
                        <h4>MainWindow.xaml.cs</h4>
                        <p>
                            Following the two method calls to the flight manager file the list of flights and passengers are loaded into the 
                            buttons and combo boxes. In the specific case of the buttons when a flight is selected the button layout is determined
                            by the make and model of the plane. The buttons are loaded in as a basic button with very few attributes. When the 
                            seats are operational they are updated to reflect the passengers and thier selected seats. An event listener is added 
                            as well as the correct background and seat number. After the flighs and passengers are loaded properly the combo boxes
                             are enabled.

                            <!-- Description -->
                            This game used a grid of buttons that players could click to place a piece on the board.
                            Once a player had four pieces
                            that matched diagonally, laterally, or vertically, they would win. The program used a
                            boolean to determine which
                            player was placing a piece and informed the winning player that they had won once their
                            winning move was performed.
                            The interesting part about this game was the way we checked for a winning combination. We
                            would pass in the buttons
                            that could form a winning combination, and if it returned true, we would find the color and
                            inform that colored player
                            that they had won.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One issue that arose with this program was that I had incorrectly labeled my UI, which
                            prevented my checks from determining
                            if the correct combination requirements had been met. After using many console logs, I
                            finally found and fixed the problem.
                        </p>
